Program wchich responds to voice commands and give answer. 
Optional it can also play music open browser or any other program if has a file path.

After 10 seconds program, if program won't get any command, will set voice recognition to stand-by mode.

To add new command we need to add new "if" in Default_SpeechRecognized function, add command name in DefaultCommands.txt
and also add it to DefaultCommands.txt in project bin to make it work properly.

Have fun with customizing commands to Your will.
